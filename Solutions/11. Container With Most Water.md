# 11. Container With Most Water
Difficulty: Medium  
Link: [https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/container-with-most-water/](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)
## Description
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.  
***Note:*** You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.  
<div align=center><img src="https://github.com/WindsorWZZ/LeetCode-Solution/blob/master/pic/LC11.jpg"></div>   
The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
### Example 1
``` 
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
```
## Analysis
### Solution 1: Brutal Force  
List all the possible areas and find the largest one.  
**Time Complexity:** O(n<sup>2</sup>)  
### Solution 2: Double Pointer  
The two pointers (i & j) start from the first and the last element respectively. Move the lower one to the center and the higher one stays still. Until the two pointers converge.  
Proof of correctness:  
When we need to move a pointer toward the center, it has to be the lower one. Because moving will shrink the bottom of the rectangle, if the smaller one stays still, the area will only become smaller.  
Moving the smaller one will ignore some cases, but it is reasonable. When we move the smaller one (i), the cases (i, j-1), (i, j-2),...(i, i+1) are eliminated, but those areas are smaller! Because the height could be less or equal to 'height(i)', and the bottom is always smaller.   
**Time Complexity:** O(n)  

## Solution   
### 1. Brutal Force
```
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int i, j, h1, h2;
        int maxArea = 0;
        if(!height.size()) return 0;
        for(i = 0; i < height.size(); i++)
            for(j = i; j < height.size(); j++)
                if(min(height[i], height[j]) * (j - i) > maxArea)
                    maxArea = min(height[i], height[j]) * (j - i);
        return maxArea;
    }
};
```
### 2. Double Pointer
```
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int i, j, h1, h2;
        int maxArea = 0;
        if(!height.size()) return 0;
        i = 0;
        j = height.size() - 1;
        while(i != j)
        {
            if(min(height[i], height[j]) * (j - i) > maxArea)
                maxArea = min(height[i], height[j]) * (j - i);
            if(height[i] > height[j]) j--;
            else i++;
        }
        return maxArea;
    }
};
```
