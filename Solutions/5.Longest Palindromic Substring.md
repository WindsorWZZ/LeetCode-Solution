# 5.Longest Palindromic Substring
Difficulty: Medium  
Link: [https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring)
## Description
Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.
## Example 1
``` 
Input: "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
```
## Example 2
```
Input: "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
```
## Analysis
Palindrome string is a kind of string which will stay the same when it is read from front to back and back to front. In other words, it is on central symmetry.  
'Center Expansion Method': 
1. Select one or two places as the centers of palindrome substring. 
2. Expand the substring on both sides when the characters at both edges are the same.
3. Record the centers and the expanded wing length when the length of palindrome substring reach the maximum.  
Time Complexity: O(n<sup>2</sup>)

## Solution
```
class Solution {
public:
    string longestPalindrome(string s) {
        int len = s.length();
        int i, j;
        int center_1, center_2, maxLen = 0, maxWing = 0;
        int wing_1, wing_2;
        if(!len) return "";
        for(i = 0; i < len; i++)
        {
            wing_1 = wing_2 = 0;
            wing_1 = expand(s, i, i);
            if(2 * wing_1 + 1 > maxLen)
            {
                maxLen = 2 * wing_1 + 1;
                center_1 = center_2 = i;
                maxWing = wing_1;
            }
            if(s[i] == s[i + 1])
            {
                wing_2 = expand(s, i, i + 1);
                if(2 * wing_2 + 2 > maxLen)
                {
                    maxLen = 2 * wing_2 + 2;
                    center_1 = i;
                    center_2 = i + 1;
                    maxWing = wing_2;
                }
            }
        }
        return s.substr(center_1 - maxWing, maxLen);
    }
    int expand(string s, int center_1, int center_2)
    {
        int wing = 0;
        int Ptr_L, Ptr_R;
        Ptr_L = center_1 - 1;
        Ptr_R = center_2 + 1;
        while(Ptr_L >= 0 && Ptr_R < s.length())
        {
            if(s[Ptr_L] == s[Ptr_R])
                wing++;
            else break;
            Ptr_L--;
            Ptr_R++;
        }
        return wing;
    }
};
