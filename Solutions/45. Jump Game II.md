# 55. Jump Game II
Difficulty: Hard  
Link: [https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/jump-game-ii/](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/jump-game-ii/)
## Description
Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.
### Example 
``` 
Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2.
    Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```
## Analysis
For every step, record the position range of launch. For example, the first step can only jump from 0, and the second step can jump from 1 to nums[0]. Loop until the upper bound of range does not increase (stuck) or the upper bound is beyond the arrays range (reach the last one). Then print out the current step.
**Time complexity:** O(n)

## Solution
```
class Solution {
public:
    int jump(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.size() <= 1) return 0;
        int step = 0;
        int start = 0;
        int end = 0;
        int nextStart = 0;
        int nextEnd = 0;
        while (true) {
            start = nextStart;
            end = nextEnd;
            for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
                if (i + nums[i] > nextEnd)
                    nextEnd = i + nums[i];
            }
            step++;
            if (nextEnd == end || nextEnd >= nums.size() - 1) break;
            nextStart = end + 1;
        }
        return step;
    }
};
```
