Difficulty: Medium  
Link: [https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/)
## Description
Given an array nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position. Return the max sliding window.

## Example
Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], and k = 3
Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7] 
Explanation: 

Window position                Max
---------------               -----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7

## Analysis
1. Solve in O(nk)  
Use brutal force method, for every position of the sliding window, find the largest one.
2. Solve in O(n)  
Use deque to store the indexes of the elements. The deque should maintain the largest, second largest.... elements. So When a new element comes in, we wish to push it from the back, and if the back element is smaller than the new one, pop it. Thus, the deque has a large-to-small sequence. We only need to push the front (largest one) to the result. Moreover, every time the sliding window moves, we should check whether the largest element's index
is in the new window, if not, we should pop it.  
**Time Complexity:** O(n)    (Every element is pushed once and poped once)
## Solution
```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> maxSlidingWindow(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        deque<int> maxDeque;
        int head = 0;
        int tail = k - 1;
        vector<int> res;
        for (int i = 0; i <= tail; ++i) {
            while (!maxDeque.empty() && nums[maxDeque.back()] < nums[i])
                maxDeque.pop_back();
            maxDeque.push_back(i);
        }
        res.push_back(nums[maxDeque.front()]);
        for (++head, ++tail; tail < nums.size(); ++head, ++tail) {
            if (maxDeque.front() < head) maxDeque.pop_front();
            while (!maxDeque.empty() && nums[maxDeque.back()] < nums[tail])
                maxDeque.pop_back();
            maxDeque.push_back(tail);
            res.push_back(nums[maxDeque.front()]);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
