# 137. Single Number III
Difficulty: Medium  
Link: [https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/single-number-iii/](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/single-number-iii/)
## Description
Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.

**Note:**
1. The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, [5, 3] is also correct.
2. Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?  

### Example 
``` 
Input:  [1,2,1,3,2,5]
Output: [3,5]
```
## Analysis
Core idea: Since a ^ a = 0, apply XOR to all the elements will get the number that appears only once. In this problem, we will get x ^ y since x and y both appear only once. What we need to do is to seperate x and y into two groups, and apply XOR to them seperately.  
Start from the 'x ^ y' we get, for every '1' bit, either x or y provide a '1' at this bit. Thus, we can use this information to divide elements into the group with x and the group with y. 
How do we find a bit that is '1' in a number? Solution: x & (-x)!!!!!
The answer is clear now: First we XOR all the elements, then find an '1' bit in the result. Traverse the array again, only XOR the numbers that has the same '1' at that bit, then we will get x (or y). To obtain the other one, we only need to do: y = (x ^ y) ^ x
**Time Complexity:**O(n)
**Space Complexity:**O(n)

## Solution
```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int XORxy = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i)
            XORxy ^= nums[i];
        int diff = XORxy & (-XORxy);
        int x = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i)
            if (diff & nums[i])
                x ^= nums[i];
        int y = XORxy ^ x;
        vector<int> res = {x, y};
        return res;
    }
};
```
