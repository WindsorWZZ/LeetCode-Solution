Link: [https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)
## Description
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.  
### Example
ex1
``` 
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
```
ex2
```
Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```
ex3
```
Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.  
```

```
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        if (s.length() <= 1) return s.length();
        int maxlen = 0;
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while (i < s.length() && j < s.length()) {
            int temp;
            int len = j - i + 1;
            for (temp = i; temp < j; temp++) 
                if (s[temp] == s[j]) {
                    i = temp + 1;
                    len = j - i + 1;
                    break;
                }
            if (len > maxlen) maxlen = len;
            j++;
        }
        return maxlen;
    }
};
