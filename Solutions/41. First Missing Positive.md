# 41. First Missing Positive
Difficulty: Hard
Link: [https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/first-missing-positive/](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/first-missing-positive/)
## Description
Given an unsorted integer array, find the smallest missing positive integer. 
**Note:**
Your algorithm should run in O(n) time and uses constant extra space.   
### Example 1
``` 
Input: [1,2,0]
Output: 3
```
### Example 2:
```
Input: [3,4,-1,1]
Output: 2
```
### Example 3:
```
Input: [7,8,9,11,12]
Output: 1
```
## Analysis
The straight-forward mind is to sort the array and traverse, but the time complexity exceeds.  Another way is to use hash table, but the space complexity exceeds.  
We use the array itself to be the hash table. First we should analyze the value of the possible missing positive integer. For an array with n elements, the missing positive has to be in [1, n+1]. We can just put the value (v) in its correct position (nums[v - 1]) during traversing, and retraverse to find which element's key doesn't match its value.  
**Time complexity:**O(n)
**Note:**When using swap to put the elements, we should pay attention to the other element, which could be in 1 ~ n+1, and will be ignored in the traverse. So a safety check should present after swapping.  
 
## Solution
```
class Solution {
public:
    int firstMissingPositive(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.size() == 0) return 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) 
            if (nums[i] <= nums.size() && nums[i] > 0) {
                swap(nums[i], nums[nums[i] - 1]);
                //safety check to prevent ignorance
                if (nums[i] <= nums.size() && nums[i] > 0 && nums[nums[i] - 1] != nums[i]) 
                    --i;
            } 
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i)
            if (nums[i] != i + 1) return i + 1;
        return nums.size() + 1;        
    }
};
```
