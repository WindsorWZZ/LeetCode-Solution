# 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence
Difficulty: Medium  
Link: [https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/)
## Description
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

### Example 1
``` 
Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4 
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4. 
```
**Note:**
There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.
**Follow up:** Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?

## Analysis
**Method 1: Dynamic programming**  
Use an array to record the maximum length ascending sequence, which includes the [i]th element.  
ex. dp[i] is the max lenth of ascending sequence, all the sequence elements are among nums[0] ~ nums[i], and it must contain nums[i].  
When we reach the [i]th element, dp[i] is determined by the former dp[j]. The j has to obey: nums[j] < nums[i], and we should select the j whose dp[j] is the largest. Under this condition, we find the longest ascending sequence which is followed by nums[i].  Thus we get dp[i]. We get the largest dp[i] through dynamically recording.  
**Time complexity:** O(n<sop>2</sop>)

## Solution
1. Dynamic programming
```
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLIS(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.size() <= 1) return nums.size();
        int dp[nums.size()];
        int maxLen = 0;
        dp[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            int maxNum = 0;
            for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; --j) {
                if (nums[j] < nums[i] && dp[j] > maxNum) maxNum = dp[j];
            }
            dp[i] = maxNum + 1;
            if (dp[i] > maxLen) maxLen = dp[i];
        }
        return maxLen;
    }
};
```
