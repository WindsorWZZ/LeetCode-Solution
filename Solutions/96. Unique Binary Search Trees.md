Difficulty: Medium  
Link: [https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees/](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees/)
## Description
Given n, how many structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values 1 ...Â n?  

### Example
``` 
Input: 3
Output: 5
Explanation:
Given n = 3, there are a total of 5 unique BST's:

   1         3     3      2      1
    \       /     /      / \      \
     3     2     1      1   3      2
    /     /       \                 \
   2     1         2                 3
```

## Analysis
The elements will be sorted in increasing order in the inorder traverse, so we can regard the sequence as an inorder array. An inorder array can be divided into root, left and right tree. Select an element as a root, the elements on its left as left tree and the elements on its right as right tree. The left and right tree array can be also divided using the method above. So we can use DP algorithm. Starting from a tree with 1 node, a larger tree can be divided into many small trees and its structures will be the combination of them.   
$$ dp[i] = \sum\limits_{j = 0}^i dp[j - 1] * dp[i - j] $$


## Solution
1. Sliding Window
```
class Solution {
public:
    int numTrees(int n) {
        int dp[n + 1];
        dp[0] = 0;
        dp[1] = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i ++) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) 
                if (j - 1 > 0 && i - j > 0)
                    sum += dp[j - 1] * dp[i - j];
                else
                    sum += max(dp[j - 1], dp[i - j]);
            dp[i] = sum;
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
};
```
