# 30. Substring with Concatenation of All Words
Difficulty: Hard  
Link: [https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/substring-with-concatenation-of-all-words/](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/substring-with-concatenation-of-all-words/)
## Description
You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without any intervening characters.  
### Example 1
``` 
Input:
  s = "barfoothefoobarman",
  words = ["foo","bar"]
Output: [0,9]
Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoo" and "foobar" respectively.
The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.
```
### Example 2
```
Input:
  s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword",
  words = ["word","good","best","word"]
Output: []
```
## Analysis
First, record the words in a hash map. Second, for every substring, also store them in a hash map, and compare the value with the words hash map. If they are the same, push it into the result vec.
## Solution
1. Hash Map
```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findSubstring(string s, vector<string>& words) {
        vector<int> res;
        if (!s.size() || !words.size()) return res;
        int wsize = words.size();
        int wlen = words[0].size();
        if (s.length() < wsize * wlen) return res;
        unordered_map<string, int> wmap;
        for (int i = 0; i < words.size(); i++) {
            if (wmap.find(words[i]) == wmap.end())
                wmap.insert({words[i], 1});
            else
                wmap[words[i]]++;
        }
        unordered_map<string, int> smap;
        for (int i = 0; i <= s.length() - (wsize * wlen); i++) {
            smap.clear();
            int wordHead = i;
            while (wordHead <= i + (wsize * wlen) - wlen) {
                string word = s.substr(wordHead, wlen);
                if (wmap.find(word) == wmap.end() || smap[word] == wmap[word]) 
                    break;
                else 
                    if (smap.find(word) == smap.end())
                        smap.insert({word, 1});
                    else
                        smap[word]++;
                wordHead += wlen;
            }
            if (wordHead == i + (wsize * wlen))
                res.push_back(i);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
