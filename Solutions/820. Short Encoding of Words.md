# 820. Short Encoding of Words
Difficulty: Medium  
Link: [https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/short-encoding-of-words/](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/short-encoding-of-words/)
## Description
Given a list of words, we may encode it by writing a reference string S and a list of indexes A.

For example, if the list of words is ["time", "me", "bell"], we can write it as S = "time#bell#" and indexes = [0, 2, 5].

Then for each index, we will recover the word by reading from the reference string from that index until we reach a "#" character.

What is the length of the shortest reference string S possible that encodes the given words?

### Example 
``` 
Input: words = ["time", "me", "bell"]
Output: 10
Explanation: S = "time#bell#" and indexes = [0, 2, 5].
```

## Analysis
Use Trie(字典树) to store the words (reversely). When adding a new word, we check it reversely:   
(1) If it is a suffix of existing words (a path of the trie), we just ignore it.  
(2) If an existing word is its suffix (reach the leaf of the trie), we add the extra part to charNum.  
(3) If it is an independent word (cannot find continue the path but haven't reach the leaf), we add the whole length of the word to charNum, and wordNum++.   
Since we don't know how many sons of a trie node, we use vector to store the sons.  
 
## Solution
```
class Solution {
    struct TrieNode {
        char ch;
        vector<TrieNode*> sons;
        TrieNode(char c): ch(c) {};
    };
public:
    int minimumLengthEncoding(vector<string>& words) {
        if (!words.size()) return 0;
        TrieNode* root = new TrieNode(0);
        int charNum = 0;
        int wordNum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < words.size(); ++i) {
            TrieNode* temp = root;
            for (int j = words[i].size() - 1; j >= 0; --j) {
                int sonNum;
                //look for duplicated char
                for (sonNum = 0; sonNum < temp->sons.size(); ++sonNum)
                    if (temp->sons[sonNum]->ch == words[i][j]) break;
                //if independent
                if (sonNum == temp->sons.size()) {
                    if (temp->sons.size() > 0 || temp == root) {
                        charNum += words[i].size();
                        ++wordNum;
                    }
                    else {
                        charNum += j + 1;
                    }
                    while (j >= 0) {
                        temp->sons.push_back(new TrieNode(words[i][j]));
                        temp = temp->sons[temp->sons.size() - 1];
                        --j;
                    }
                }
                else temp = temp->sons[sonNum];
            }
        }
        return charNum + wordNum;
    }
};
```
