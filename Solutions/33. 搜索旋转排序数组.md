# 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
Difficulty: Medium  
Link: [https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)
## Description
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).  

### Example
ex1
``` 
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```
ex2
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```

## Analysis
The ascending array will become two ascending sequences after rotation. When doing binary search, we should identify whether the subsequence is in ascending order or not.  
We can judge from the realtionship between nums[mid], nums[tail] and target, to determine whether to apply binary search or rotated binary search to the next part.

## Solution
1. Binary search
```
class Solution {
public:
    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        if (nums.size() == 0) return -1;
        return rSearch(nums, target, 0, nums.size() - 1);
    }
    int bSearch(vector<int>& nums, int target, int head, int tail) {
        if (head == tail && nums[head] != target)
            return -1;
        int mid = (head + tail) / 2;
        int res;
        if (nums[mid] == target)
            return mid;
        if (nums[mid] > target)
            res = bSearch(nums, target, head, mid);
        else 
            res = bSearch(nums, target, mid + 1, tail);
        return res;
    }
    int rSearch(vector<int>& nums, int target, int head, int tail) {
        int mid = (head + tail) / 2;
        int res;
        if (head == tail && nums[head] != target)
            return -1;
        if (nums[mid] > nums[tail]) 
            if (nums[mid] == target)
                return mid;
            else if (nums[mid] > target && target > nums[tail])
                res = bSearch(nums, target, head, mid);
            else
                res = rSearch(nums, target, mid + 1, tail);
        else if (nums[mid] < nums[tail])
            if (nums[mid] == target)
                return mid;
            else if (target > nums[mid] && target <= nums[tail])
                res = bSearch(nums, target, mid + 1, tail);
            else
                res = rSearch(nums, target, head, mid);
        return res;
    }
};
