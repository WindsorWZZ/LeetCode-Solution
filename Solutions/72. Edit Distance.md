# 72. Edit Distance
Difficulty: Hard  
Link: [https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/edit-distance/](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/edit-distance/)
## Description
Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

Insert a character
Delete a character
Replace a character

### Example 1
``` 
Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
```
### Example 2
```
Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')
```

## Analysis
String matching, obviously, dynamic programming.  
We manage an array of dp[i][j], which records the minimum edit distance between the first i elements of word1 and first j elements of word2.  
Then we think about the state transform: At every step, what we can do is to insert, delete or replace. So the distance between two words, is also determined by the distance between the words after an operation.  
ex:
If we need to do insert first: dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1] + 1
(It's better to match i with j - 1, to match with j, we should insert word2[j])  
Do delete first: dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + 1
(It's better to match i - 1 with j, so we should delete the useless word1[i])    
Do replace: dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
(i - 1 and j - 1 are matching well, so we just need to replace word1[i] with word2[j]. **Note:** When word1[i] == word2[j], dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1], no need to replace)  
To find which operation to do, we just need to use min() to get the smallest distance after this operation.  
 
**Time complexity:** O(mn)
## Solution
**Dynamic programming**
```
class Solution {
public:
    int minDistance(string word1, string word2) {
        if (word1.size() == 0) return word2.size();
        if (word2.size() == 0) return word1.size();
        int dp[word1.size() + 1][word2.size() + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i <= word1.size(); ++i)
            dp[i][0] = i;
        for (int i = 0; i <= word2.size(); ++i)
            dp[0][i] = i;
        for (int i = 1; i <= word1.size(); ++i)
            for (int j = 1; j <= word2.size(); ++j) {
                if (word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1])
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j - 1], min(dp[i - 1][j] + 1, dp[i][j - 1] + 1));
                else 
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i - 1][j - 1], min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]));
            }
        return dp[word1.size()][word2.size()];
    }
};
```
