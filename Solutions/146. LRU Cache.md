# 146. LRU Cache
Difficulty: Medium   
Link: [https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/lru-cache/](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/lru-cache/)
## Description
Design and implement a data structure for Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. It should support the following operations: get and put.

get(key) - Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.
put(key, value) - Set or insert the value if the key is not already present. When the cache reached its capacity, it should invalidate the least recently used item before inserting a new item.

The cache is initialized with a positive capacity.

Follow up:
Could you do both operations in O(1) time complexity?
### Example 
``` 
LRUCache cache = new LRUCache( 2 /* capacity */ );

cache.put(1, 1);
cache.put(2, 2);
cache.get(1);       // returns 1
cache.put(3, 3);    // evicts key 2
cache.get(2);       // returns -1 (not found)
cache.put(4, 4);    // evicts key 1
cache.get(1);       // returns -1 (not found)
cache.get(3);       // returns 3
cache.get(4);       // returns 4
```
## Analysis
Since the complexity should be O(1), we have to use hash map to search when we do get(). And we should always find the LRU data, which means we should sort the data in a sequence. We can use linked list to store them, the first one is the LRU one, each time we use a data, it should be moved to the tail of the list. To do this in O(1), we need a double linked list.  
Thus, the hash map could store the address of the node in the linked list, we can locate it in the linked list in O(1). And we record the head and the tail of the linked list, to achieve O(1) movement.
**Time complexity:** O(1)

## Solution
```
class LRUCache {
public:
    LRUCache(int capacity) {
        capa = capacity;
        head = new node(0, 0);
        tail = new node(0, 0);
        head->next = tail;
        tail->previous = head;
    }
    
    int get(int key) {
        if (m.find(key) == m.end()) return -1;
        else{
            node* temp = m[key];
            temp->previous->next = temp->next;
            temp->next->previous = temp->previous;
            temp->previous = tail->previous;
            temp->next = tail;
            tail->previous->next = temp;
            tail->previous = temp;
            return m[key]->value;
        }
    }
    
    void put(int key, int value) {
        if (m.find(key) == m.end()) {
            if (m.size() == capa) {
                node* temp = head->next->next;
                m.erase(head->next->key);
                head->next = temp;
                temp->previous = head;
            }
            node* added = new node(key, value);
            added->previous = tail->previous;
            added->next = tail;
            tail->previous->next = added;
            tail->previous = added;
            m.insert({key, added});
        } else {
            node *target = m[key];
            target->value = value;
            target->previous->next = target->next;
            target->next->previous = target->previous;
            target->previous = tail->previous;
            target->next = tail;
            tail->previous->next = target;
            tail->previous = target;
        }
        return;
    }
private:
    struct node {
        int key;
        int value;
        node* previous;
        node* next;
        node(int k, int v):key(k), value(v), previous(NULL), next(NULL) {}
    };
    unordered_map<int, node*> m;
    int capa;
    node* head;
    node* tail;
};
