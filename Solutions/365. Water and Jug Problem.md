# 365. Water and Jug Problem
Difficulty: Medium  
Link: [https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/water-and-jug-problem/](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/water-and-jug-problem/)
## Description
You are given two jugs with capacities x and y litres. There is an infinite amount of water supply available. You need to determine whether it is possible to measure exactly z litres using these two jugs.  

If z liters of water is measurable, you must have z liters of water contained within one or both buckets by the end.  

Operations allowed:  

Fill any of the jugs completely with water.
Empty any of the jugs.
Pour water from one jug into another till the other jug is completely full or the first jug itself is empty.  
### Example 1: (From the famous "Die Hard" example)
``` 
Input: x = 3, y = 5, z = 4
Output: True
```
### Example 2:
```
Input: x = 2, y = 6, z = 5
Output: False
```
## Analysis
**Bezout's Identity:**  
```
ax + by = z has integral solution, only when z is a multiple of the greatest common divisor between x and y.    
```
In this problem, the current volume of water has to be ax + by, target volume is z. We can check if z is a multiple of x and y's gcd. Calculate gcd through division algorithm. Besides, we should be aware of the margin cases: a and b cannot be larger than 1 simultaneously, and x, y or z could be 0.  
Time Complexity: O(xy)  
 
## Solution
```
class Solution {
public:
    bool canMeasureWater(int x, int y, int z) {
        if (x == 0 || y == 0) {
            if (z == 0) return true;
            else return false;
        }
        if (z > x + y) return false;   
        if (z % GCD(x, y) == 0) return true;
        else return false;
    }
    int GCD(int x, int y) {
        int divisor;
        if (x > y) {
            divisor = y;
            if (x % y == 0) return divisor;
            else return GCD(x % y, y);
        }
        else {
            divisor = x;
            if (y % x == 0) return divisor;
            else return GCD(x, y % x);
        }
        
    }
};
```
