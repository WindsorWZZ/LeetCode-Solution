# 398. Random Pick Index
Difficulty: Medium  
Link: [https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/random-pick-index/](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/random-pick-index/)
## Description
Given an array of integers with possible duplicates, randomly output the index of a given target number. You can assume that the given target number must exist in the array.  

**Note:**
The array size can be very large. Solution that uses too much extra space will not pass the judge.  

### Example
``` 
int[] nums = new int[] {1,2,3,3,3};
Solution solution = new Solution(nums);

// pick(3) should return either index 2, 3, or 4 randomly. Each index should have equal probability of returning.
solution.pick(3);

// pick(1) should return 0. Since in the array only nums[0] is equal to 1.
solution.pick(1);
```
## Analysis
Store the keys of the target elements in an array, use rand() to pick one in the array. 

## Solution
```
class Solution {
public:
    Solution(vector<int>& nums):pool(nums) {
        
    }
    
    int pick(int targetc) {
        vector<int> pos;
        for (int i = 0; i < pool.size(); i++)
            if (pool[i] == target) pos.push_back(i);
        return pos[rand() % pos.size()]; 
    }
private:
    vector<int> pool;
};

/**
 * Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * Solution* obj = new Solution(nums);
 * int param_1 = obj->pick(target);
 */
