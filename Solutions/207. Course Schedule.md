#207. Course Schedule
Difficulty: Medium  
Link: [https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/sort-list/](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/sort-list/)  
## Description
There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?


### Example 1
``` 
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```
### Example 2
```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```
## Analysis
**Method: Topological ordering**  
The course requirement is a directed graph, we can get the topological order of the graph, if all the courses can be taken during ordering, the schedule is available. To acquire the topological order, we select the courses whose indegree is zero at a time, and reduce the following courses by 1.  
**Time Complexity:** O(V + E)

## Solution
```
class Solution {
public:
    bool canFinish(int numCourses, vector<vector<int>>& prerequisites) {
        if (numCourses <= 1) return true;
        vector<int> indegree(numCourses, 0);
        vector<vector<int> > nextCourses(numCourses);
        //Generate indegree table (E)
        for (int i = 0; i < prerequisites.size(); ++i) {
            indegree[prerequisites[i][0]]++;
            nextCourses[prerequisites[i][1]].push_back(prerequisites[i][0]);
        }
        queue<int> q;
        int taken = 0;
        //first round course (V)
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; ++i) {
            if (indegree[i] == 0) 
            {
                q.push(i);
                indegree[i] = -1;
                taken++;
            }
        }
        //take courses by sequence (E)
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int temp = q.front(); q.pop();
            for (int i = 0; i < nextCourses[temp].size(); ++i) {
                indegree[nextCourses[temp][i]]--;
                if (indegree[nextCourses[temp][i]] == 0) {
                    q.push(nextCourses[temp][i]);
                    indegree[nextCourses[temp][i]] = -1;
                    taken++;
                }
            }
        }
        //Check if all the courses taken
        if (taken == numCourses) return true;
        else return false;
    }
};
```
