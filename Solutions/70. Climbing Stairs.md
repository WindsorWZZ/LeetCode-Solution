# 55. Jump Game II
Difficulty: Hard  
Link: [https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/climbing-stairs/](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)
## Description
You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Note: Given n will be a positive integer.  
### Example 1
``` 
Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```
### Example 2
```
Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```
## Analysis
For a height n, if we have to jump to n - 1 or n - 2. Thus, How many ways can we jump to n - 1 or n - 2 depends how we can jump to n.   
dp[n] = dp[n - 1] + dp[n - 2]  
**Time complexity:** O(n)

## Solution
```
class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n < 3) return n;
        int dp[n + 1];
        dp[1] = 1;
        dp[2] = 2;
        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++)
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
        return dp[n];
    }
};
```
