# 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
Difficulty: Medium  
Link: [https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)
## Description
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).  

### Example
ex1
``` 
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```
ex2
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```

## Analysis
The ascending array will become two ascending sequences after rotation. When doing binary search, we should identify whether the subsequence is in ascending order or not.

## Solution
1. Sliding Window
```
class Solution {
public:
    int numTrees(int n) {
        int dp[n + 1];
        dp[0] = 0;
        dp[1] = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i ++) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) 
                if (j - 1 > 0 && i - j > 0)
                    sum += dp[j - 1] * dp[i - j];
                else
                    sum += max(dp[j - 1], dp[i - j]);
            dp[i] = sum;
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
};
```
